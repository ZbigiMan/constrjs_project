### Why?

The **constrjs** project was started in my head during searching for new job. I had to do some test task - create simple web app without using any JS framework or lib like Angular or ReactJS. I wrote some simple ES6 code which I started to improve - I didn't get that job... 

### What is the contrjs project?

This is the bundle of ES6 modules/classes helping to create JS SPA app:

* [**RouterModule**](https://github.com/ZbigiMan/constrjs_project/wiki/RouterModule) - client router
* [**StoreModule**](https://github.com/ZbigiMan/constrjs_project/wiki/StoreModule) - watchable app store
* [**DOMModule**](https://github.com/ZbigiMan/constrjs_project/wiki/DOMModule) - DOM elemets manipulation
